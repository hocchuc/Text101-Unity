# Text101-Unity
Project to learning Unity basic 

What I learn from this project:

- Sprite
- Canvas
  - Text, Image from UnityEngine.UI
- SerializeField, Serialize Array
- GameObject
- ScriptableObject

  Throughout a project, I learned about basic game design, create sprite in Unity, how to use some component in Unity.
  Aditionally, I also learned to set up Unity project in Git platform, attach debug to Unity, build apk, set up sdk, ndk, jdk...
